## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19.1.1** + **TypeScript 5.9.2** + **Vite 7.1.3**
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.17** for responsive design
- **Jest + Testing Library** for comprehensive testing

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Real-time fraud detection dashboard
- KPI data: GET /api/fraud/stats → Dashboard cards
- Live alerts: SSE /api/sse/alerts/stream → Real-time notifications  
- Driver data: GET /api/drivers → Searchable/filterable table
- Fraud triggers: POST /api/fraud/detect/all → Manual detection
```

### Key Features Operational
- 🔴 **Critical fraud alerts** with severity-based color coding
- 📊 **Real-time KPI updates** every 30 seconds  
- 🔍 **Advanced driver filtering** by risk level, status, search terms
- 📱 **Fully responsive design** mobile/tablet/desktop
- ♿ **Accessibility compliant** with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
