# ✅ RESOLVED: Database Agent - Database Test Failures Fixed  
**Date**: 2025-08-22
**Priority**: LOW → RESOLVED
**Issue Type**: Database Test Failures

## ✅ Resolution Summary
**Database Agent successfully resolved all database test failures**

**Root Cause:** Test expectations didn't match actual database schema after recent table migrations and structure changes.

**Schema Mismatches Fixed:**
1. ✅ Fixed companies table test - expected `email` column, actual is `contact_email`
2. ✅ Fixed drivers table test - expected `name` and `fraud_score`, actual is `first_name`, `last_name`, `risk_score`  
3. ✅ Fixed vehicles table test - expected `vehicle_id` column, actual is `vin`
4. ✅ Fixed fraud_alerts table test - expected `company_id`, actual structure uses `entity_id`

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `/tests/database.test.js` - Updated all schema expectations to match current database structure

## ✅ Verification Results
- **Test Status**: ✅ ALL PASSING - 12/12 database tests successful
- **Schema Validation**: ✅ All required tables verified with correct structure
- **Data Integrity**: ✅ Foreign key relationships and constraints working
- **Performance**: ✅ Query optimization tests passing with indexes
- **Test Execution**: ✅ Fast completion (0.298s vs previous 90s timeouts)

## Business Impact
**RESOLVED:** Database test suite now fully operational supporting CI/CD pipeline and database reliability validation.

## Test Verification
