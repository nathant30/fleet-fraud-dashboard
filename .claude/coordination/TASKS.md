## Backend Agent Tasks
**Updated:** 2025-08-22 15:15:00 UTC

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL P0 - SYSTEM DEGRADATION - IMMEDIATE ACTION
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE TASK:** Fix remaining Supabase null errors in routes
  - **STILL ACTIVE**: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'from')" in drivers.js:43 and vehicles.js:45
  - **LATEST ERRORS**: Continuing through 16:00:21 - auth bypass didn't fix route errors
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Routes still calling supabase.from() with null supabase client
  - **SPECIFIC FIX**: Replace all supabase.from() calls with database adapter or SQLite fallback
  - **FILES TO FIX**: routes/drivers.js, routes/vehicles.js, any other routes using supabase.from()

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Development Authentication Bypass  
  - Implement immediate auth bypass for development environment
  - Skip JWT validation when NODE_ENV=development
  - **AUTHORIZATION GRANTED**: Modify any auth files needed - proceed immediately

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Performance optimization for fraud detection algorithms
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement API rate limiting per company
- [ ] Add webhook system for real-time fraud notifications

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY  
- [ ] Authentication improvements (refresh token, session management)
- [ ] Advanced fraud pattern analysis algorithms
- [ ] Bulk fraud detection processing capabilities

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Express server setup and basic API structure
- [x] 7 core fraud detection algorithms implementation
- [x] JWT authentication and API key validation
- [x] Database connection configuration

## QA Agent Tasks
**Updated:** 2025-08-22 15:15:00 UTC

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL P0 - SYSTEM HEALTH EMERGENCY  
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE TASK:** Run comprehensive system diagnostic and error analysis
  - **ESCALATING**: Now 6 consecutive health check failures (getting worse)
  - **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Correlate health failures with Supabase null errors in logs
  - **SPECIFIC ACTIONS**: 
    1. Test all API endpoints individually and document failure rates
    2. Run load testing to identify which endpoints are consistently failing
    3. Create system health report with specific recommendations
    4. Monitor system recovery after Backend Agent fixes routes
  - **AUTHORIZATION**: Full diagnostic authority - use any tools needed

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY
