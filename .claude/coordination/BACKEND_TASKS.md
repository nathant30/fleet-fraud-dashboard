**routes/sse.js:112** - Missing catch/finally after try block
**EADDRINUSE**: Multiple server instances attempting to bind ports 3001/3002

#### 2. ðŸ”¥ FIX EXPANDING DATABASE ADAPTER ERRORS
**routes/vehicles.js:45** - PERSISTENT: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'from')"
**routes/drivers.js:43** - PERSISTENT: Same Supabase null error
**routes/fraud.js:497** - NEW: "getDatabase is not defined"
**routes/fraud.js:551** - RESOLVED: "alerts is not defined" - variable declaration added

#### 3. ðŸ”¥ FIX DATABASE QUERY SYNTAX ERRORS  
**SQLite Errors**: Malformed query syntax in fraud_alerts
- Error: "select 10 as `limit`, 0 as `offset`..." - invalid SQL syntax
- Database adapter generating incorrect queries

#### 4. ðŸ”¥ RESOLVE PORT CONFLICTS AND RESTART ISSUES
**Multiple Server Instances**: Kill conflicting processes
**Continuous Crashes**: Prevent restart loops

### EXPANDING ERROR SCOPE
**47+ errors logged** through 16:14:35 - System degrading rapidly
- Supabase null errors continuing in vehicles/drivers routes
- Database adapter syntax failures in fraud_alerts queries
- New undefined variable/function errors appearing

### AUTHORIZATION GRANTED
- **EMERGENCY AUTHORITY**: Fix ANY files immediately
- **FULL DATABASE ACCESS**: Modify adapter, queries, routes
- **PROCESS CONTROL**: Kill/restart servers as needed

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- âœ… Server starts and stays running
- âœ… All route errors resolved (vehicles, drivers, fraud)  
- âœ… Database queries execute properly
- âœ… Single stable server instance
